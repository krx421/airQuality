Brachiopods have been reported at several localities, but except for the stromatolites, the unit, for the most part, is unfossiliferous. Lithology is quite varied. Though dolostone is predominant, sandstone and mixed sandstone and dolostone beds are common. The mineralogy of the Little Falls is extremely varied. Unit includes quartz, calcite, dolomite, pyrite, marcasite, galena, sphalerite, limonite, chalcopyrite, hematite, glauconite, and anthraxolite. Inferred age of the quartz crystals is Carboniferous, while deposition of the limestone occurred during the Late Cambrian (Muskatt and Tollerton, 1992). Hoyt - Named the Hoyt limestone member of the Little Falls dolomite for Hoyt's quarry, Saratoga Co., eastern NY. Unit is basal phase of the Little Falls. Consists of blackish, subcrystalline, pure or only slightly magnesian limestone alternating with beds of blue and light gray dolomite; quartz sand grains in some of the beds, increasing in amount below; contains many beds of black oolite, most abundant near the base. Fossils include Cryptozoan, trilobites, gastropods, and LINGULEPIS ACUMINATA at many horizons. Thickness is 80 to 120 feet. Gradationally overlies the Potsdam sandstone and underlies the remainder of the Little Falls dolomite. Unit occurs locally. The Hoyt is of Late Cambrian age (Ulrich and Cushing, 1910).The base of the Whitehall formation is raised to coincide with contact of Little Falls dolomite and Hoyt limestone, and Hoyt is revised as lower member of Whitehall formation. The Hoyt limestone member is about 40 feet thick and underlies the Skene dolomite member (Wheeler, 1942).",NY001,dolostone (dolomite),limestone,chert,NY002NY037NY038NY039NY040NY041NY046

Usually very bioturbated, but contains few shelly fossils. The Hanover changes eastward into siltier, upslope deposits of the Wiscoy Member southeast of the type section at Java Village. Fossils include a mixture of benthic and pelagic fossils, goniatites and carbonized driftwood fragments. Small rugose corals and crinoid ossicles also occur. The Frasnian-Famennian stage boundary position has been tentatively placed several meters below the top of this unit by Kirchgasser (pers. comm. 1989).In outcrop in western NY, the Java consists of a basal black shale, the Pipe Creek Shale Member, and an overlying gray shale and mudrock with scattered beds of black shale and siltstone, and abundant limestone nodules, the Hanover Shale Member. The Pipe Creek thins to the east and feathers out in northern Stuben Co. The Hanover, however, thickens to the east and grades laterally into the Wiscoy Sandstone Member. The Pipe Creek rarely exceeds 25 ft in thickness, but makes up much of the radioactive black shale in the Java. In the subsurface, it extends south from western NY about 450 mi to Scott Co., VA.

NY046) and reference NY017:Middle Devonian Onondaga of NY represents broad, carbonate platform facies deposited during early to middle Eifelian time. Carbonates are characterized by calcarenitic to cherty to argillaceous limestones and minor shales deposited in a shallow epicontinental sea. The Selinsgrove Limestone Member of the Needmore Formation of central PA is the direct equivalent of the Onondaga Limestone in NY. The Onondaga is generally subdivided into four members across NY: Edgecliff, Nedrow, Moorehouse, and Seneca. These four members are directly equivalent to those of the Buttermilk Falls Limestone of eastern PA. The Clarence Member has been recognized only in western NY and is here designated a local informal facies of the Edgecliff. The informal Jamesville Quarry facies of the Edgecliff is also named in this report for the chert-poor, crinoidal pack- and grainstone that occurs at the Edgecliff type locality. Several marker beds within the Nedrow Member are recognized and the upper boundary with the Moorehouse Member is redefined. The Moorehouse contains several fossil horizons and the Seneca contains several bentonite beds, including the Tioga B or Onondaga Indian Nation Bentonite, which defines its base. The Lower-Middle Devonian (Emsian-Eifelian) boundary, long placed at the base of the Onondaga in NY, could lie as high as the base of the Nedrow Member according to Kirchgasser and Oliver (1993), as there are no age diagnostic fossils in the Edgecliff (Brett and Ver Straeten, 1994).The Seneca Member of the Onondaga Formation as now defined is part of a general fining-upward trend that extends from the underlying upper part of the Moorehouse Member into the overlying Marcellus Formation at its type section. Deposition of member is more complex than previously thought as details reveal that it contains two cycles rather than one, indicating two deepening intervals. The upper contact of the Seneca as defined in this report is marked by a thin, apparently widespread lag bed with fish bone material. Member is thickest in the central Finger Lakes area. Thins eastward and is eventually cutout near Albany. Contains a relatively low diversity fauna. Chonetid and atrypid brachiopods are abundant and LEPTAENA, common; rugose corals are uncommon. Fine to medium-grained wacke- to packstones dominate the unit. In outcrop appears as thick-bedded to massive limestones separated by thin shaly to bentonitic partings. Light-weathering chert is present mainly in the western region. Thin dark shales increase in number toward the top. Base is marked by the Onondaga Indian Nation Ash (Tioga B of PA), which differs from boundary as defined by Conkin, who placed the base of the Seneca 0.47 to 1.25 m above the base of the bentonite. As many as eight Tioga Ash Beds may occur in the Seneca Member, including the Tioga B. At the Seneca Stone quarry, 8.5 km northwest of the type section, the member is 7.1 to 8.4 m thick, depending upon placement of the upper contact, and underlies the Bakoven Member of the Union Springs Shale [shown in chart as assigned to Marcellus subgroup]. Zone L, as the transitional 1.3-m-interval was labeled by Oliver (1954) was assigned by him to the Seneca. However, authors follow Conkin and Conkin (1979) in assigning interval to the overlying Union Springs. Age of the Seneca is Middle Devonian (Eifelian) (Brett and Ver Straeten, 1994). Authors informally propose two dominant, widespread facies of the Edgecliff Member of the Onondaga Limestone: the cherty, micritic Clarence facies, formerly known as the Clarence Member of western NY, and a coarse crinoidal, non- to sparsely cherty Jamesville Quarry facies. The Jamesville Quarry is present at the Edgecliff type locality near Syracuse, where it reaches a thickness of about 5.7 m. To the west the Edgecliff thins to a minimum of 2.5 m at Seneca Stone quarry. The only trace of Clarence-like lithology at this location is a distinctive 0.5 m-thick band of cherty calcisiltite 1.8 m above the base of the Edgecliff. Between Seneca Stone quarry and Phelps the Edgecliff thickens and is composed primarily of sparsely fossiliferous calcisiltites with abundant bands of dark gray to black chert, closely resembling the typical western NY Clarence facies. Total thickness of the Edgecliff reaches a maximum of 14 m. Unit underlies calcareous shale-dominated strata and laterally equivalent argillaceous limestones of the Nedrow Member. The Foxtown Member of the Buttermilk Falls Limestone of eastern PA is directly equivalent to the Edgecliff. The basal contact is conformable in parts of eastern NY, but westward becomes unconformable and overlies increasingly older Devonian to Silurian strata. In some parts of west-central to western NY, overlies upper Lower Devonian Tristates Group and elsewhere the Middle Devonian Hamilton Group.

Carbonates are characterized by calcarenitic to cherty to argillaceous limestones and minor shales deposited in a shallow epicontinental sea. The Selinsgrove Limestone Member of the Needmore Formation of central PA is the direct equivalent of the Onondaga Limestone in NY. The Onondaga is generally subdivided into four members across NY: Edgecliff, Nedrow, Moorehouse, and Seneca. These four members are directly equivalent to those of the Buttermilk Falls Limestone of eastern PA. The Clarence Member has been recognized only in western NY and is here designated a local informal facies of the Edgecliff. The informal Jamesville Quarry facies of the Edgecliff is also named in this report for the chert-poor, crinoidal pack- and grainstone that occurs at the Edgecliff type locality. Several marker beds within the Nedrow Member are recognized and the upper boundary with the Moorehouse Member is redefined. The Moorehouse contains several fossil horizons and the Seneca contains several bentonite beds, including the Tioga B or Onondaga Indian Nation Bentonite, which defines its base.

Deposition of member is more complex than previously thought as details reveal that it contains two cycles rather than one, indicating two deepening intervals. The upper contact of the Seneca as defined in this report is marked by a thin, apparently widespread lag bed with fish bone material. Member is thickest in the central Finger Lakes area. Thins eastward and is eventually cutout near Albany. Contains a relatively low diversity fauna. Chonetid and atrypid brachiopods are abundant and LEPTAENA, common; rugose corals are uncommon. Fine to medium-grained wacke- to packstones dominate the unit. In outcrop appears as thick-bedded to massive limestones separated by thin shaly to bentonitic partings. Light-weathering chert is present mainly in the western region. Thin dark shales increase in number toward the top. Base is marked by the Onondaga Indian Nation Ash (Tioga B of PA), which differs from boundary as defined by Conkin, who placed the base of the Seneca 0.47 to 1.25 m above the base of the bentonite. As many as eight Tioga Ash Beds may occur in the Seneca Member, including the Tioga B. At the Seneca Stone quarry, 8.5 km northwest of the type section, the member is 7.1 to 8.4 m thick, depending upon placement of the upper contact, and underlies the Bakoven Member of the Union Springs Shale [shown in chart as assigned to Marcellus subgroup]. Zone L, as the transitional 1.3-m-interval was labeled by Oliver (1954) was assigned by him to the Seneca. However, authors follow Conkin and Conkin (1979) in assigning interval to the overlying Union Springs.

At Seneca Stone quarry, the Nedrow is approximately 4.2 m thick. The basal shales are typically medium dark gray, but contain scattered brachiopods and rugose corals. The lower 3 m consists of alternations of medium gray, sparsely fossiliferous, calcareous shales, and gray, somewhat nodular, highly argillaceous and noncherty limestones. Above this interval are several prominent marker beds, including the shaly SCHIZOPHORIA bed at the top of the Nedrow that can be traced from the Syracuse region to central PA in the middle portion of the Selinsgrove Limestone, and to the mid-Hudson Valley area in the Onondaga.

The Jamesville Quarry is present at the Edgecliff type locality near Syracuse, where it reaches a thickness of about 5.7 m. To the west the Edgecliff thins to a minimum of 2.5 m at Seneca Stone quarry. The only trace of Clarence-like lithology at this location is a distinctive 0.5 m-thick band of cherty calcisiltite 1.8 m above the base of the Edgecliff.

The Angola is not recognized east of the Genesee River, although the Rhinestreet is present near Elmira in central Chemung Co., NY. The Rhinestreet is also identified in the subsurface from western NY to eastern TN. In outcrop in TN, the Rhinestreet is a 6-ft bed in the lower part of the Dowelltown Member of the Chattanooga Shale. The Belpre Ash Bed is present in the lower part of the Rhinestreet in the western part of the Appalachian basin. In the subsurface, the Angola is recognized from western NY to eastern TN and westward into OH and eastern KY.

NY046) and reference NY036:The Utica Shale is divided in the Mohawk Valley into upper and lower parts by a tongue of the Dolgeville Formation and these parts are here assigned member names. The lower portion of the Utica is named the Flat Creek Member and the upper, the Indian Castle Member. These lithostratigraphic units replace earlier names such as the Canajoharie Shale, which are primarily biostratigraphic. Revised stratigraphic correlations based on reinterpretation of graptolites and K-bentonites in the area suggest that the lower part of the Utica Shale is the lateral equivalent of a large part of the lower Trenton Group and is older than the Denley Limestone, with which it has been previously equated. The Flat Creek Member overlies the early to middle Kirkfieldian Kings Falls Limestone of the Trenton Group at Canajoharie Creek and interfingers with the Sugar River Limestone of the Trenton Group to the west. The Trenton-Utica succession is a transgressive sequence. Westward, the Dolgeville grades into the lower Denley and the Utica (equivalent to only the upper Utica of the east) disconformably overlies the Denley and Steuben Limestones of the Trenton Group. The Utica underlies the Frankfort Formation throughout the study area. Age of the Utica between Chuctanunda Creek and Caroga Creek, ranges from Kirkfieldian (Mohawkian) to Edenian (Cincinnatian). Formation youngs westward and at Trenton Falls the entire unit is shown as Maysvillian (Cincinnatian). The following figure is adapted from Fig. 14 of Goldman and others (1994).

Westward from Genesee Gorge, outcrops become infrequent. At Lockport the entire Reynales is assigned to the Hickory Corners Member, though the strata there are equivalent to the Brewer Dock Member and the lower 120 cm of the Wallington.

Unconformably underlies the Bear Creek Shale facies (a correlative of the Wallington Member) and unconformably overlies the Webster Bed (new) (a correlative of the Maplewood and Neahga Shales) (LoDuca and Brett, 1994).Maplewood - As currently defined, the basal formation of the Clinton Group in Monroe Co., NY, is the Maplewood Shale, and in western NY and adjacent Ontario, the Neahga Shale. The base of both formations is marked by the distinctive phosphatic Densmore Creek Bed (new). The Maplewood varies in thickness thinning both east and west of the type section. Formation is absent at Webster, 10 km northeast of Glen Edith where it is 5.0 m thick. The Maplewood underlies the Reynales Limestone, the base of which is marked by the Budd Road Bed, and overlies the Kodak Sandstone or Cambria Shale of the Medina Group. The Maplewood has a sparser fossil assemblage than the correlative Neahga Shale to the west and its Llandoverian B-2 to C-1 age assignment is based for the most part on its physical continuity with the Neahga (LoDuca and Brett, 1994).The Kodak Sandstone of the Medina Group in western NY consists of medium-gray to white, argillaceous, quartzose sandstone.

Unit B is a 4 to 6 foot thick interval of contorted, dark-gray, laminated, oolitic dolomite with black shale partings, and includes a middle zone of uniform, medium bluish-gray, oolitic dolomite with thin, dark shaly partings and beds with dolomicrite intraclasts. Unit C forms a transition zone between the Guelph and the overlying Vernon Shale and is similar to unit B, but contains vugs and interbedded zones of fine-grained, olive-gray to greenish-gray, argillaceous dolomite and thin, black or dark-gray, shaly partings.

Thickness of the Goat Island is 26 to 56 feet and averages 42 feet. Conformably and unconformably overlies the Gasport Dolomite and unconformably underlies the Eramosa Dolomite. East of Brockport, Monroe Co., NY, the Goat Island appears to correlate with the upper part of the Penfield Formation. The Goat Island is probably of Early and Late Silurian (latest Wenlockian and earliest Ludlovian) age based on conodonts (Brett and others, 1995).Revised the Gasport to the Gasport Dolomite of the Lockport Group and divided unit into two members, the Gothic Hill and Pekin Members.

The basal contact of the High Falls is placed at the base of the first red bed above the uppermost quartzite or conglomerate of the Shawangunk Formation and the upper contact is gradational with the overlying Binnewater Sandstone. Unit ranges from 46 to 100 feet thick. The High Falls Shale has been confused by some earlier workers as being equivalent to the Bloomsburg Red Beds.Rondout and Decker Formations mapped undivided, but discussed separately in text. Decker is light- to medium-gray, calcareous quartz siltstone and sandstone, locally a fine-pebble conglomerate. Locally interbedded with medium-gray, medium to coarse-grained, thin- to medium-bedded limestone and very fine-grained dolomite. Total thickness approximately 72 ft. Lower contact with Bossardville Limestone is gradational. Age is Late Silurian.Bossardville Limestone mapped in northwestern NJ. Composed of medium-gray to medium-dark-gray, very fine-grained, argillaceous limestone and limestone, weathers medium bluish gray. Unit is thin-bedded, laminated to ribbon-textured. Desiccation columns and cracks occur in southwestern part of map area. Total thickness is approximately 100 ft. Lower contact with Poxono Island Formation is gradational and placed at top of uppermost dolomite. Underlies Decker Formation. Age is Late Silurian.The Poxono Island Formation is about 500 feet thick at Port Jervis, NY, and gradually thins to the north toward Ellenville where it is about 300 feet thick. Consists of laminated, platy, thin-bedded, greenish-gray calcareous siltstone, dolostone, and light-greenish-gray shale. Between Accord and High Falls, NY the Poxono Island grades laterally into the Binnewater Sandstone. The Poxono Island overlies the Bloomsburg Red Beds or the High View Tongue of the Shawangunk Formation and underlies the Bossardville Limestone or Rondout Formation. Unit is of Late Silurian age.",NY001,siltstone,limestone,sandstone; dolostone (dolomite); shale,NY002NY046
